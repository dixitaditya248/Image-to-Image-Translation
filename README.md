# Image-to-Image-translation
In this, I used unsupervised image-to-image transformation using VAEs, GANs which basically learns a joint distribution of
images in different domains by using images from the marginal distributions in individual domains. As there exist infinite set of joint
distributions that can arrive the given marginal distributions, one could infer nothing about the joint distribution from the marginal
distributions without additional assumptions. To address the problem, I make a shared-latent space assumption and propose an
unsupervised image-to-image translation framework based on Coupled GANs. I compare the proposed framework with competing
approaches and present high quality image transformation results on various challenging unsupervised image transformation tasks,
including lab interior images and mobile phone image transformation. I also apply the proposed framework to domain adaptation
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

DataSet - I used my own data set.
